> - `Resource`: Specifies the AWS resources the statement applies to
> - `Principal`: Specifies the entities (users, roles, etc.) the statement applies to

## 4. Action Field

> "arn:aws:s3:::jam-challenge-patientdata-us-east-1-569419362345"

## 7. Principal Specification

## 8. Policy Interpretation

**Q: What is the overall effect of this IAM policy?**

> [!note]- Answer
> This policy does two things:
> 1. Denies USER-A all actions on the specified S3 bucket
> 2. Allows USER-B all actions on the same S3 bucket

## 9. Multiple Statements

**Q: Why might a policy have multiple statements, as seen in this example?**

> [!note]- Answer
> Multiple statements allow for more complex and specific permission sets. In this case, it allows different permissions (Allow vs Deny) for different users on the same resource.

## 10. Policy Evaluation

**Q: If USER-A and USER-B both try to access the S3 bucket, what will happen based on this policy?**

> [!note]- Answer
> Based on this policy:
> - USER-A will be denied access to the S3 bucket for all actions
> - USER-B will be allowed to perform all actions on the S3 bucket
