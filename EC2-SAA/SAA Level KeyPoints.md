- VPC (Virtual Private Cloud): A logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network you define.
- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud): A web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud, allowing you to run virtual servers.
- Placement Groups: Logical groupings of EC2 instances that influence how instances are placed on underlying hardware.
- ENI (Elastic Network Interface): A virtual network interface that you can attach to an instance in a VPC.
- VPC Subnets: Segments of a VPC's IP address range where you can place groups of isolated resources.
- Security Groups: Act as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.
- Placement Group Types: Include Cluster (low latency), Spread (individual critical instances), and Partition (groups of instances).
- ENI Attributes: Include a primary private IPv4 address, one or more secondary IPv4 addresses, one Elastic IP address per private IPv4 address, one public IPv4 address, and one or more IPv6 addresses.
- VPC Peering: A networking connection between two VPCs that enables routing using private IP addresses.
- EC2 Instance Types: Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, and networking capacity to meet different use cases.
