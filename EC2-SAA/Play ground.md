1. create a Custom VPC:
    - Create a VPC with multiple subnets across different Availability Zones.
    - Set up public and private subnets.
    - Configure route tables and an Internet Gateway.
2. EC2 Instance Deployment:
    - Launch EC2 instances in different subnets of your VPC.
    - Connect to your instances using SSH (for Linux) or RDP (for Windows).
3. Placement Groups:
    - Create different types of placement groups (Cluster, Spread, and Partition).
    - Launch EC2 instances into each type of placement group.
    - Compare network performance between instances in different placement groups.
4. Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs):
    - Create an ENI with a specific private IP address.
    - Attach and detach the ENI from different EC2 instances.
    - Associate an Elastic IP with the ENI and test connectivity.
5. Security Groups and Network ACLs:
    - Create and configure security groups for your EC2 instances.
    - Set up Network ACLs for your subnets.
    - Test connectivity between instances with different security group rules.
6. VPC Peering:
    - Create two VPCs and establish a VPC peering connection between them.
    - Launch EC2 instances in each VPC and test communication across the peering connection.
7. Bastion Host Setup:
    - Set up a bastion host in a public subnet.
    - Use the bastion host to access EC2 instances in private subnets.
8. NAT Gateway:
    - Set up a NAT Gateway in a public subnet.
    - Configure private subnet instances to use the NAT Gateway for internet access.
9. VPC Endpoints:
    - Create a VPC Endpoint for S3.
    - Test access to S3 from an EC2 instance using the VPC Endpoint.
10. Multi-ENI Configuration:
    - Launch an EC2 instance type that supports multiple ENIs.
    - Attach multiple ENIs to the instance, each in a different subnet.
    - Configure routing and test network connectivity.
11. Elastic IP Address Management:
    - Allocate Elastic IP addresses.
    - Associate and disassociate Elastic IPs with EC2 instances and ENIs.
12. Cross-AZ ENI Attachment:
    - Create ENIs in different Availability Zones.
    - Try attaching them to instances in different AZs to understand the limitations.
